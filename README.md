# Track hub for UCSC Genome Browser with RNA structures (panhandles)
## There are two kinds of tracks - all panhandles in MXE cluster and those that are homologous
### Homologous panhandles have extended name. This includes dG, average phastCons score for an arm (score_L and score_R) and id
### ID is needed to visually find a homolog in a paralogous gene
